This is a fork of Jonathan Neeser's original thermal simulation for chamber cooling design. The only changes made here are to import chamber contours, so you are no longer limited to conical/parabolic estimations, and to update deprecated numpy functions.
I suggest using Anaconda for managing imports, as pip doesn't work for me. This also requires GMSH, which can be annoying to get working at times.
